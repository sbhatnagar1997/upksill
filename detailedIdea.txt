Detailed Idea Overview

Purpose: Lay out a project plan in detail.

Goal: Gather live time data from twitter to see if tweets can indicate how well is currently doing/is predicted to do with Covid.


Workflow:
---Fundamental work -------------------------

1) Python -> Twitter API to gather tweet data.
- Look for tweets with a pre-set category indicated by keywords. These keywords will be relevant to Covid-19.
- Store the data/gather the data in two ways:
  > AWS S3 data lake: store raw json data of the tweets for future analysis (live time updating every time code is run)
  > SQL server (local? or maybe AWS SQL?): Create a ERD to store data in structured manner.
- Analyze the data using NLP (?) or ML to see how these tweets match up with open-source covid data.

2) AWS S3 -> Data lake to store raw tweet data

3) Relational Database -> Database to store structured data (local or cloud based (need to investigate))

4) NLP in Python -> Analyze the tweet content to output covid performance indicators

5) ML in Python -> Use current data (of tweeets and covid) as training and predict how we expect things to change OR which countries are doing well and what measures we have for this

--- Future/Potential work-------------------

6) Travis/ Jenkins -> Automated code testing

7) Use flask to create a website/app for interactivity
