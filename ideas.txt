Data Engineering Project Ideas:

Goal: UpSkill core training tech stack
1) Python
2) ML
3) SQL
4) Big Data: hadoop, sqoop
5) Visualization (though this will not be free)

Create a data engineering related project that would take maybe 1/2 weeks that would allow me to upskill/refresh my memory with the tech stack learnt.

Ideas:

1) Webscrape some sort of data webiste (either direct scraping or API based)
- Covid? Jobs? Stock Market prices?
- TECH: python

2) Store data in a database/create a relational model for the incoming data
- TECH: SQL/Hadoop (sqoop etc)
- Create a ERD (entity relationship diagram)

3) Use sklearn in Python to process and analyze the data in a useful way
- TECH: ML (python)
- Classification or regression? Best algorithm, loss function?

4) Some sort of interactive website, output
- Either a visual or some sort of interactive/filter based analysis
- Git repo to showcase skills


Additional Ideas:
- Potentially deploy on some sort of PaaS (AWS)
- Use jenkins/travis to automate testing of the project
- Use PyCharm or spyder (maybe PyCharm as it is more production friendly)
