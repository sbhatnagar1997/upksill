There's plenty of local press reporting about the situations in Northern Italy and the NYC area.

USA 67000
Spain 25000
Italy 29000
Uk 28000
France 24000
Belgium 7000
Germany 7000

How on earth can Thailand only have 50 deaths, South Africa 120 deaths, Ukraine 280?!!

Is it correct?
Did the CDC just revise the national COVID-19 deaths to 37K?

(The so-called "huge outbreak in Italy" was revised to less than 15% of the original count.)

It is worth noting, tho, that while Italy has identified 12,000+ people with +ive Corvid19 tests, 3 MILLION PEOPLE had Influenza this winter by late January this year, mostly in Lombardy, Valle d'Aosta & Friuli Vezia Giulia. Influenza is the one that kills the young, not Covid!
-----Line of Text------------
During the last flu season, the worst-affected parts of Italy were Valle d'Aosta, Lombardy, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Emilia-Romagna, Marche and Abruzzo in the centre-north. 
Whereas the regions worst hit by Covid were Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, Marche, and Lombardy.

You are dumb. 3 months ago, China had 100% of Covid deaths. Two months ago, Italy had 20%. It's called epidemiological spread. We're in the second wave. When the season is over, and all countries are hit and tallies are taken, then talk.

Mortality rate.

When I do the math I get 5.4%.

If Michigan has 65,000 infections and 6,500 deaths due to COVID-19, isn't that 10%?

Sure it changes by place and by hour but nationwide steady at 5.4%

What am I missing?

It can be said of reported cases 5.4% will die.

In a couple of hospitals in Italy, Cosenza and Livorno, Italian media are reporting they are testing Ruxolitinib (7 patients so far) to prevent the worst stage of the covid-19 disease. If it give some promise, they may start a proper trial. They're looking into IL6/JAK/STAT.
-----Line of Text------------
Clinical trial started in Italy for off-label use of Ruxolitinib ( trade names Kakadu and Jakavi).
Target is avoid critical evolution of covid-19 patients and reduce the need of critical bed admissions.
Trial ongoing at Livorno hospital (Tuscany)under MD Spartaco Sani.
-----Line of Text------------
The 27 March an experiment was started with 7 Covid patients in Cosenza and Livorno, giving them ruxolitinib. The anecdotal feedback is promising. It would be interesting, because it is downstream (IL-6 activates the JAK/STAT pathway). The drug inhibits JAK and reduces IL-6.

It's not "contested". It's false. Genetic sequences suggest Italian strain is too distant from the Wuhan strain. Tracing attempts point to a pre-existent similar Munich outbreak. No Chinese in Prato had covid, and, as of 8 March, only one Chinese out of 2600 cases in Milan.

It is worth noting, tho, that while Italy has identified 12,000+ people with +ive Corvid19 tests, 3 MILLION PEOPLE had Influenza this winter by late January this year, mostly in Lombardy, Valle d'Aosta & Friuli Vezia Giulia. Influenza is the one that kills the young, not Covid!

Problem is, how do you know what order people were infected unless you know what order symptoms arrived (and we still don‚Äôt really know how covid presents in kids fully) or you do genetic studies on virus to detect mutations (which may not work in families)
-----Line of Text------------
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not a paeds issue, but Aus government stance is this. Covid has a very low immediate mortality in children (if adequate hospital support) hence they think they can get away with it.
-----Line of Text------------
If the old boots survive, without any weird stuff going on, then kids. At the end of the day, covid still kills adults far in excess of kids. Adults need the vaccine more, and our uptake may even provide significant herd immunity for kids.
