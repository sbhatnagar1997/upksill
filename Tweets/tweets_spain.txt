Teresa Ribera, Minister of Ecological Transition, on why covid is worse in Spain than Portugal:
The virus came from the East and since Portugal's a little farther West, it had more time.
Also, the first case of covid in Asturias came from Portugal in late February.  pic.twitter.com/jkHBxRanbo

No hard data, just what Sanchez said. He said data comes from the CCAA. Many, like Asturias, publish the data, but I don't think they all do. If you're looking for anything specific maybe go to the regional health authority's Twitter or Covid website.
