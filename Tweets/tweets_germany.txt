Someone should tell all these people praising Germany for our handling of COVID that we just went on lockdown 4 weeks ago with over 13.000 infected in Hessen.

And it’s not strict lockdown, we’re  not being controlled, just advised to stay home, wear masks and don’t gather.

Robert Herbin: the biggest figure in St Etienne history has died. 10 French league titles: 6 as player; 4 as coach + led  ASSE to 1976 European Cup final loss to Bayern. Even coaching Lyon didn't detract from his Green aura. Died at 81 on Mon 27 April (unrelated to Covid-19).

No one is advocating doing anything to put those vulnerable to COVID-19 at greater risk. But it’s very much an open debate, now that we have locked down the nation for 45 days to slow the spread, what the best practices will be for all Americans heath and well-being.

I understand we are permitted to go out for a walk or run, but there’s a psychological aspect to this. And a leadership aspect. We need more people at every level reinforcing how COVID-19 is not a significant threat for the young and relatively healthy.

I don't think anyone does. ONS data is only up to 17 April. But by then official COVID related deaths were at 19,000, compared to the 14,500 hospital deaths at that point. Excess deaths, though, were 26,000.

FT estimates well over 40,000 by now, although I think that looks high.
-----Line of Text------------
Cumulatively, that is over 26,000 excess deaths weeks 13-16.
Of which just over 19,000 are registered as COVID.
Compared with about 14,000 that were reported at the time of 17 April.

I think we are getting well towards the FT estimate of over 40,000 by now.  https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1255054974851170305 …
