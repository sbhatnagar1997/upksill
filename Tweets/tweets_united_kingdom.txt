The senior center next to me lost 34 in a month,  On March 22nd at my covid sickness peak (101.2), there were 10 tests at Highland Hospital I was told to call 911 if I couldnt breath but to stay home. I recovered. Most people recover.
So I'll tell myself it's fake propaganda?

Plan for the Premier League 19/20:

Liverpool need 6 points to win the league, so PL will restart the PL and cram games in as quick as possible. At least 2 games will be played before someone at a PL club contracts/dies from COVID, so they‚Äôll award title and stop season then.

In London Borough Newham the mortality rate (not the CFR) is already 1.44 per 1,000. That's extra deaths from 1st March to 18th April.

Maybe 20% of people in Newham have already caught Covid. 

If 80% catch it maybe 4 times as many will die, ~6 , from COVID

That's  1 in 170.

The death toll so far is over 28,000 and still rising because, unlike flu, warm weather is not stopping Covid. Counting the total excess deaths (most will be untested Covid) it's likely over 50K.

And that's with lockdown. Without it, 500K may die

Half marathons? I do one a day. Doing something 'X times a day' used to mean 'X each day', eg "100K #Covid tests a day". Now it means just on one day. (Even if you cheated.)

I've run halves on four days, so am ahead of UK #govt on my target of one half marathon a day.
