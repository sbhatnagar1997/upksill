COVID-19 is a socialist wet dream. Governors in Michigan, Oregon, New Mexico and elsewhere, who seek to control people‚Äôs lives and, like Obama, resent the Constitution‚Äôs constraints on government power, are doubling down.

@WhiteHouse So, they're (Puerto Rico) withholding FEDERAL stimulus checks directed to the U.S. Virgin Islands, in an attempt to embezzle FEDERAL funds, because they haven't qualified for COVID-19 stimulus relief. That's a premise for military action.

Quickly returning to a form of normalcy. Idaho has less COVID cases than most states, we have fewer large metro areas, so we are blessed in that regarding the spreading of the virus. Stores are observing 6-foot distancing rules. Not many wearing masks, except in the hospitals.

Requiring me to wear a mask at a Costco in Boise, Idaho is beyond unnecessary. The entire state has only had 75 Covid ICU hospitalizations. That‚Äôs it.
63 total statewide Covid. deaths. Yet, 101 people died of the regular flu in Idaho last year. 
And Costco has had NO outbreaks??
