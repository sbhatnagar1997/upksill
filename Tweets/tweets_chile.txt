#Covid_19 virus has now been imported into Boggabri by couple who brought the disease back from Thailand and refused to quarantine. Lucky @nswpolice caught them but who did they expose to the terrifying virus?Hopefully not drive-in mine workers at Boggabri or Maule‚Äôs Creek mines.

And that's the conspiracy... Dotardism is more contagious than the covid itself. Trump the Con is responsible for the lack of leadership. He said by now we should have zero cases... Instead more than 65k deaths

Chile police again release without charge ‚Äògreen Nobel prize‚Äô winner, Mapuche chief Alberto Curamil, just 3 months after he was cleared of all wrongdoing relating to an alleged bank robbery.

Today he was arrested at a #COVID checkpoint near his Araucania home, held for 5 hours.  https://twitter.com/PiensaPrensa/status/1247689267683475457¬†‚Ä¶

Yeah Temuco (Araucania region) is a real hot spot area, all started by one guy flying from Santiago to Temuco despite having Covid-19 symptoms. More prevalent in the south than the north in general - more tourism there being one factor I believe.  pic.twitter.com/4gb2014HYq
