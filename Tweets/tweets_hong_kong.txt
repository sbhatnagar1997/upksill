@FoxNews During the 1957 Asian flu and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemics that both killed 70,000 to 116,000 Americans there was no large economic shutdown as we see with Covid-19.  Has the US government and the world grossly overreacted?

Well this was seen in Hong Kong where the flu season ended one month earlier. Lockdown and social distancing incl masks, reduces influenza too. The increase in pneumonia is presumably Covid-19, whether diagnosed or not

"Covered mouths have a voice."
wow such powerful message.
Yes, we all do. Hong Kong government tries to silence us with so called COVID-19 precautionary measures.
Hongkongers are well aware of the coronavirus threat and consider public health concerns. But we will carry on.

The Hong Kong Flu killed 100,000 over the course of a year with no mitigation. 

COVID-19 looks like it‚Äôs about to kill 100,000 over the course of two months with severe mitigation in place.

31) Covid never took off in Hong Kong because the people led the effort. The state had very little work to do when they actually kicked into gear. Mass adoption of pathogen defense is the silver bullet, but there has been no attempt to do that in the US.

To suppress upheavals in Hong Kong with a newly developed B-weapon of virus from a western country, however, in vain. His subordinate ‚Äúexperts‚Äù mishandled the virus and spread it in Wuhan city, the actual beginning of all the events and issues related to COVID-19.
